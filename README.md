This notebook goes over various machine learning techniques to clean and process data. This model is able to predict if a driver will finish top 5 in a race based on prior race conditions. This model was created using age, experience, start position, as well as some other synthetic features that try to capture the idea of momentum. If a driver performs well in previous races, they'll probably perform well in future races.
